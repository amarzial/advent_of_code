# Advent of code

An attempt to solve all the "Advent of Code" puzzles in rust with an eye on performance.

Running a day also prints the execution time for each part.
Example

```
$ cargo solve 2022_11
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
     Running `target/debug/2022_11`
Part 1 (time: 253.32µs)
 102398
Part 2 (time: 84.91ms)
 23641658421
```

## Usage

`cargo prepare <year> <day>` creates the source, input and example files
`cargo solve <year>_<>` runs the specified day
